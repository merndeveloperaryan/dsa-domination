Literal or Constant:
Any constant value which can be assigned to the variable.

DATA TYPES:
Data types are used to classify and define the type of data that a
variable can hold.
There are 2 types of Data Types:
1.Primitive Data types: pre-defined, fixed size.
2.Non-Primitive Data types: Customize and no fixed size.

DataTypes: 
    Primitive:
        Integer family:
            byte -> Ranges -> 2^7 to -2^7-1  -> size: 1 bytes
            short -> Ranges -> 2^15 to -2^15-1  -> size: 2 bytes
            int -> Ranges -> 2^31 to -2^31-1  -> size: 4 bytes
            long -> Ranges -> 2^63 to -2^63-1  -> size: 8 bytes

        Floating Number:
            Float -> Ranges -> 3.4^38 to 3.4^38  -> size: 4 bytes
            Double -> Ranges -> 1.7^308 to 1.7^308  -> size: 4 bytes

        Character -> Ranges -> 0 to 65535(2^16-1) -> size: 2 bytes
        Decision -> JVM specific -> boolean : true or false

    Non Primitive:
        User defined classes example -> String


Data Type   Default Value (for
            fields)
byte         0
short        0
int          0
long         0L
float        0.0f
double       0.0d
char         '\u0000'
boolean      false

the compiler never assigns a default value to an uninitialized local
variable.
