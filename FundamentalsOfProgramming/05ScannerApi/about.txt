Scanner
To take input from users we use Scanner class.
Scanner class is a built-in class in the java.util package(DTL). Before
using the Scanner class you have to import the Scanner class using the
import statement as shown below:
To use the Scanner class, you need to create an object of it, and then
you can use that object to interact with the input data.

The nextInt() method parses the token from the input and returns the
integer value.

Use methods to read respective data
nextByte(), nextShort(), nextInt(), nextLong(), nextFloat(), nextDouble(),
nextBoolean()

Reading String Data
nextLine() - Reads the whole line
next() - Reads the first word

Reading char data – next().charAt(0)

Problem with nextLine() method:
If we try to read String after reading in an Integer, Double or Float etc.
Java does not give us a chance to input anything for the name variable.

When the method input.nextLine() is called Scanner object will wait for
us, to hit enter and the enter key is a character(“\n”).

1. We first prompt the user to enter an integer age using nextInt().
2. After reading the integer, we immediately hit enter and enter is
also a character represented by “\n” – 69\n
3. The int value 69 is assigned in age but not the \n still left in the
memory or buffer.
4. In next line when we Call nextLine() to consume the name it first
check in buffer is there any thing as we have \n in buffer it take \n
(for nextLine() method \n is the stopping point it will consider we
stop giving input and return) and skip the line.


1. After taking an integer input we Call nextLine() to consume the name
character left in the input buffer.In next line when we Call nextLine() to
consume the name character left in the input buffer.
2. Then, we prompt the user to enter a string using nextLine().
\ is a special symbol
\n (next Line), \b (backspace), \t (tab), \" (double quote), \' (single
quote), and \\ (backslash).
