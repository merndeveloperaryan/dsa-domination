JDK --> JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT
● It is a collection of software tools, libraries, java compiler JRE etc.
● It enables developers to write, compile, and run Java programs.

Compiler
● It translates the entire source code of HLL into LLL or an
intermediate code(closer to machine code) in a single step.
● It scans syntax errors.

Interpreter
● The interpreter translates HLL line by line.


WHOLE PROCESS OF RUNNING A JAVA CODE
● Java compiler translates source code into byte code.The JVM (DTL) loads
and executes the byte code. Optionally, some JVMs may choose to
interpret the byte code directly for certain use cases.This combination
of compilation and interpretation allows Java programs to be both
platform-independent (byte code run on any machine).

Class- Collection of methods and variables. It is concept of OOPs(DTL).

Method - A method is a block of code which performs certain
operations and returns output(DTL).

Entry Point
The main method is the entry point for executing a Java application.
When you run a Java program, The JVM or java compiler looks for
a public static void main(String args[]) method in that class, and the
signature of the main method must be in a specified format for the JVM
to recognize it as its entry point.

If we update the method's signature, the program will throw the
error NoSuchMethodError:main and terminate.
