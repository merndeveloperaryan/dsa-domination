Package
A Java package is a collection of similar types of sub-packages,
interfaces, and classes. They help you manage and group related
classes, interfaces, and sub-packages to avoid naming conflicts and
create a more organized and maintainable codebase.

Example:
Directories or folders on your computer's file system(manage files).
In Java, there are two types of packages: built-in packages and
user-defined packages.

in-built packages : They are available in Java, including util, lang, awt
etc. We can import all members of a package using package
name.* statement

java.lang is a special package that is automatically imported by default
in every Java class.
Commonly used classes and types from the java.lang package include:
String, System, Math etc.

User-defined packages: User-defined packages are those that the users
define. Inside a package, you can have Java files like classes, interfaces,
and a package as well (called a sub-package).

Math Class
java.lang.Math class is a built-in class. It provides mathematical
functions and constants for mathematical operations.

Commonly used methods and constants:
Math.abs(a) Returns the absolute value of a value.
Math.sqrt(a) Returns the sqrt root of a double value.
Math.ceil(a) Returns the closest value that is greater than or equal to the
argument
Math.max(a, b) Returns the greater of two values.
Math.min(a, b) Returns the smaller of two values.
Math.pow(a, b) Returns a raised to the power of b.
Math.random() Returns a double value with a positive sign, greater than or equal to 0.0
and less than 1.0

Math.PI, Math.floor(a)(closest value that is greater than or equal to the
argument) etc.
