2. End: Can end with an alphabet or _ or $ or numeric digit.
3. No Reserved Words : You cannot use Java's reserved words (also
known as keywords) as identifiers.
4. No Special Symbols: Identifiers cannot contain special symbols like @,
#, %, etc. except for underscores (_) and dollar signs ($).

specific meanings and cannot be used as identifiers.e.g.public, class,
static, if, else, while etc.

camelCase --> used to name methods and variables example - main, lastName etc.
PascalCase --> Used to name classes, interfaces.
snake_case --> Can be used in place of camelCase but it is not recommended in java.
