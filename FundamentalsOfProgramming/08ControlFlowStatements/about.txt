CONTROL-FLOW STATEMENTS
Control Flow statements in programming control the order of execution
of statements within a program. They allow you to make decisions,
repeat actions, and control the flow of your code based on conditions.

Types of control flow statements
1. Conditional or Decision Making statements (if-else and switch)
2. Looping statements (for, while, and do-while)
3. Branching statements (break and continue)

1.Conditional statements If-else :
The if-else statement allows you to execute a block of code
conditionally.

If the condition inside the if statement is true, the code inside the if
block is executed;

otherwise, the code inside the else block is executed.

"If-Else-If" ladder consists of an if statement followed by multiple else-if
statements. It is used to evaluate a condition using multiple statements.
The chain of if statements are executed from the top-down.

It checks each if condition, and as soon as one of the if condition
yields true, it executes the statement inside that if block and skip the
rest of the ladder. If none of the conditions evaluates to be true, then
the program executes the statement of the final else block.

If Ladder :
"If" ladder consists of an multiple if statements. It is used to evaluate a
condition using multiple statements. The chain of if statements are
executed from the top-down.

The program checks each if condition, and as soon as one of
the if condition yields true, it executes the statement inside that if block
and still check further conditions. If none of the conditions evaluates to
be true, then the program executes the statement of the
final else block.
